-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for playing MONOCHROME!

Before you begin to play, or try to run the provided .py file (main.py),
you must download and extract the contents of the MONOCHROME
folder onto your computer. 

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>To do this, simply download and put the MONOCHROME folder into
>the "Pictures" folder of your computer. After this, the file path of this
>folder will be ---------> C:\Users\?\Pictures\MONOCHROME
>
>After this process is completed, go into the setup_and_run.py AND
>level_registry.py files in Eclipse/other IDE, and CTRL+F to find and
>replace the file path name "trist" with your Windows user.
>
>Finally, go into the DATA folder (inside the MONOCHROME folder), and
>install the provided font "android.ttf".
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

From here, you may run the provided main.py file in Eclipse/other IDE.

Controls and instructions for the game are located in the game's
